# Problem

Farmes who grow potatoes are facing lot of economic losses every year because of various diseases that can happen to a potato plant. 

There are two common diseases known as early blight and late blight. Early blight is caused by a fungus and late blight is caused by a specific microorganism. 

If a farmar can detect these diseases early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save lot of waste and prevent the economic loss. 

The treatments for early blight and late blight are a little different, so it's important that accuractely identify what kind of disease is there in that potato plant.

# Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

Every data science project starts with data collections process. Basically we have three options to collect the data:
  * Get data from some website or buy from third party vendor
  * Collect and annotate data on your own
  * Web scraping scripts to collect images from internet

In this project, we'll use ready-made data, from kaggle.
The dataset used is provided on the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village



2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Model building
4. Deployment
