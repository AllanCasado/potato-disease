# Problem

Farmes who grow potatoes are facing lot of economic losses every year because of various diseases that can happen to a potato plant. 

There are two common diseases known as early blight and late blight. Early blight is caused by a fungus and late blight is caused by a specific microorganism. 

If a farmar can detect these diseases early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save lot of waste and prevent the economic loss. 

The treatments for early blight and late blight are a little different, so it's important that accuractely identify what kind of disease is there in that potato plant.
